## Hypothesis
The latent space of notes in a musical composition can be modeled as a sequence of `chords`, defined mathematically as any combination of audible tones related by a common harmonic series with a fundamental frequency within some limited domain.

## Method
### The Root
For the purpose of this experiment, the `root` of a sequence of note data is an instantaneous measure defined as the highest frequency with respect to which all notes in the sequence are an integer multiple, within some margin of error.
### Calculating the Root
### Model Architecture
~todo~
